# Variables

## Concept
**Variables** are containers for storing data values temporarily, such as numbers and characters. They allow us to refer to these values by name and manipulate them throughout a program's execution.

In C, you must specify both a **name** and a **data type** when creating a variable, using the following syntax:
```c
data_type name = value;
```
- **data_type**: Determines the type of value that will be stored in it (such as `int` or `float`). 
- **name**: The identifier you use to refer to the variable (such as `age` or `myName`). 
- **=**: The assignment operator, used to assign a value to the variable. 

Create a variable called **myNum** of type **int** and assign the value **15** to it:
```c
int myNum = 15;
```
You can also declare a variable without assigning a value, and assign the value later:
```c
// Declare a variable
int myNum;

// Assign a value to the variable
myNum = 15;
```
> [!NOTE]
> If a variable is used before it has been assigned a value, its contents are undefined and may contain any random data left in memory.

In C, every variable must be declared before it is used. You can also declare **multiple variables of the same data type** in a single statement by **separating their names with commas**:
```c
data_type name1, name2, name3;
```
```c
int age, number, sum;
```

You can update a variable's value as long as the new value is of the **same type**, using the assignment operator =:
```c
// Create an integer variable
int number = 3;

// Update the value
number = 22;

// Attempting to assign a float value to an int variable will cause an error.
number = 3.5; // Error: Cannot assign a float value to an int variable.
```
### Rules for Naming Variables in C
Variable names in C must follow these rules:
- Variable names must **only** contain **letters**, **digits**, and **underscores**.
- Variable names must **start with a letter or an underscore.**
- Variable names **cannot contain whitespace or special characters** like %, #, !, ?, etc.
- Variable names **must not be reserved words** (keywords).
- Variable names are **case-sensitive** (`myVar` and `myvar` are different variables). 

## Example
- Create a variable called **num** of type **int** and assign the value **20**.
```c
int main() {
    int num = 20;
    return 0;
}
```
- Create a variable called **length** of type **float** and assign the value **10.5**.
```c
int main() {
    float length = 10.5;
    return 0;
}
```
- Create a variable called **letter** of type **char** and assign the value **A**.
```c
int main() {
    char letter = 'A';
    return 0;
}
```

## Practice
Create an integer variable to store the result of a mathematical expression as its value.
