# Variables

## Concept

**Variable** is a named storage location that can hold a value, such as numbers and characters, which may change during the execution of a program.

In C, you must specify both a **name** and a **data type** when creating a variable, using the following syntax.
```c
data_type name = value;
```
- **data_type**: Determines the type of value that will be stored in the variable (such as `int` or `float`). 
- **name**: The identifier you use to refer to the variable (such as `age` or `myName`). 
- **=**: The assignment operator, used to assign a value to the variable. 

### Create a Variable
Let's create a variable called **weight** of type **float** and assign the value **5.5** to it.

```c
float weight = 5.5;
```
You can also declare a variable without assigning a value immediately, and assign a value later.
```c
// Declare a variable
float weight;

// Assign a value to the variable
weight = 5.5;
```

### Declare Multiple Variables
In C, every variable must be declared before it is used. You can also declare **multiple variables of the same data type** in a single statement by **separating their names with commas**.
```c
data_type name1, name2, name3;
```
For example:
```c
int age, number, sum;
```
### Update a Variable
You can update a variable's value as long as the new value is of the **same type**, using the assignment operator `=`.
```c
// Create an integer variable
int number = 3;

// Update the value
number = 22;
```

### Rules for Naming Variables in C
Variable names in C must follow these rules:
- Variable names can contain **letters**, **digits**, and **underscores**.
- Variable names must **start with a letter or an underscore.**
- Variable names **cannot contain whitespace or special characters** like %, #, !, ?, etc.
- Variable names **must not be reserved words** (keywords).
- Variable names are **case-sensitive** (`myVar` and `myvar` are different variables). 

## Example
- Create a variable called **num** of type **int** and assign the value **20**.
```c
int main() {
    int num = 20;
    return 0;
}

```
- Create a variable called **length** of type **float** and assign the value **10.5**.
```c
int main() {
    float length = 10.5;
    return 0;
}
```

## Practice
- Create an integer variable with an initial value of 5.
- Print the variable's value.
- Update the value to 17.
- Print the value after the update.
