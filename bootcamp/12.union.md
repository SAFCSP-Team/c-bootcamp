# Data Type Modifiers 

**Modifiers** are keywords you can use with basic data types (such as `int`, `char`, `double`) to change their properties, including their **size in memory** and the **range of values** they can represent.

### Modifiers

| Modifier    | Meaning                                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `signed`    | Allows both negative and positive numbers (default for most types)                  |
| `unsigned`  | Allows only zero and positive numbers              |
| `short`     | Reduces the size and range of the type                                            |
| `long`      | Increases the size and range of the type                                          |

>[!NOTE]
> The actual size and range are determined by your system and compiler.

## How to Use Modifiers
Modifiers are placed before the data type, and can be combined as needed:

```c
unsigned int count;
long int big_number;
unsigned short int small_positive;
unsigned long int big_number;
```
>[!NOTE]
> The order of modifiers doesn’t matter: `long unsigned int` is the same as `unsigned long int`.


## Modifiers with the `int` Type
All four modifiers can be used with `int`:
- **`signed int`** (default): Can store both negative and positive values.
- **`unsigned int`**: Can only store zero and positive values, but doubles the maximum representable positive value compared to `signed int`.
- **`short int`**: Stores a smaller range of values and typically uses less memory (commonly 2 bytes).
- **`long int`**: Stores a larger range of values and typically uses more memory (commonly 4 or 8 bytes).
- **Combinations** (e.g., `unsigned short int`): Modify both the sign and size.

**Example:**
```c
signed int balance = -100;          
unsigned int age = 25;               
short int s = 32000;                 
unsigned short int us = 65000;       
long int l = 2000000000L;            
```

## Modifiers with the `char` Type

- **`signed char`**: Stores character values as signed numbers (typically -128 to 127).
- **`unsigned char`**: Stores character values as unsigned numbers (0 to 255).
- **`short char`** and **`long char`**: *Not valid* in standard C programming language.

**Example:**
```c
signed char ch1 = 'A';    
unsigned char ch2 = 'b';   
```

## Modifiers with Floating-Point Types

With floating-point types, **only `long`double** is valid. All the other modifiers are not allowed.

| Type                | Valid  |
|---------------------|--------|
| `signed float`      | No     | 
| `unsigned float`    | No     |
| `short float`       | No     |
| `long float`        | No     | 
| `signed double`     | No     | 
| `unsigned double`   | No     | 
| `short double`      | No     | 
| `long double`       | Yes    |

**Example:**
```c
float f = 3.14f;
double d = 3.1415926535;
long double ld = 3.141592653589793238L;
```

## Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    short int a = 32767;
    unsigned int b = 4000000000U;
    signed char ch = 'c';
    unsigned char uch = 'n';
    long double pi = 3.141592653589793238L;

    printf("Short: %d\n", a);
    printf("Unsigned: %u\n", b);
    printf("Signed char: %d\n", ch);
    printf("Unsigned char: %u\n", uch);
    printf("Long double: %Lf\n", pi);
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Short: 32767
Unsigned: 4000000000
Signed char: 99
Unsigned char: 110
Long double: 3.141593
```
## Practice

- Write a C program that declares **five variables**, using a different valid combination of data type modifiers.
- Use `printf()` to display the value of each variable, using the correct format specifier.
- Use `sizeof()` to print the size of each variable.
