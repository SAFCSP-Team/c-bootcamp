# Socket

## What is a Socket?

A **socket** is an endpoint for sending and receiving data across a network. It is a combination of an IP address and a port number, which uniquely identifies a service on a host machine. Sockets provide a way for programs to communicate over a network using protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

1. **TCP Socket**: Used for ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
2. **UDP Socket**: Used for sending messages without establishing a reliable connection.

## What is TCP?

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees:
- Reliable delivery of messages.
- Ordered delivery (data arrives in the order it was sent).
- Error checking and recovery.

When using TCP, a connection must be established before any data transfer occurs, ensuring that both parties are ready to communicate. TCP is ideal for applications where data integrity is critical, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.

## What is UDP?

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is a connectionless protocol that:    
- Sends messages (datagrams) without establishing a connection.
- Does not guarantee reliable delivery or ordered messages.
- Lacks built-in error checking and recovery.

UDP is faster and requires less overhead compared to TCP, making it suitable for applications where speed is more crucial than reliability, such as video streaming, online gaming, and voice over IP (VoIP).

## Differences Between TCP and UDP

| Feature                     | TCP                                | UDP                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Reliability                  | Guarantees reliable delivery       | No delivery guarantees |
| Ordering                     | Ensures ordered delivery           | No ordering guarantees |
| Use Cases                   | Web browsing, file transfers       | Streaming, gaming      |


### Socket Implementation

#### Socket Type
- TCP: Uses `SOCK_STREAM` to indicate a connection-oriented socket.     
- UDP: Uses `SOCK_DGRAM` to indicate a connectionless socket.

#### Connection Handling
- TCP: Requires establishing a connection using `listen()`, `accept()`, and `connect()` before data transmission.    
- UDP: No connection establishment; utilizes `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` for direct packet exchanges.    

#### Reliability
- TCP: Ensures reliable delivery of data; guarantees order and error-checking with acknowledgment mechanisms.    
- UDP: Does not guarantee reliable delivery; faster and more lightweight, suitable for applications like streaming and gaming where speed is prioritized.


## Code Examples

-  How a server and client communicate by exchanging messages without establishing a connection, using the UDP protocol.

## Practice
Create an application where a client sends a message to a server, and the server responds with the message converted to uppercase.

> The Practice should be solved using **TCP** or **UDP**.

**Set Up the Server**
- Create a socket.
- Bind the socket to a specific port (e.g., 8080).
- For **TCP**, listen for incoming connections; for **UDP**, wait for messages.
- On receiving a message from the client, convert the message to uppercase.
- Send the uppercase message back to the client.

**Set Up the Client**
- Create a socket.
- For **TCP**, connect to the server using the server's IP address and port; for **UDP**, prepare the server address.
- Prompt the user to enter a message.
- Send the message to the server.
- Receive the transformed message (now in uppercase) from the server.
- Print the received uppercase message.
