# Loop
Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to **execute a block of code repeatedly**, as long as a certain condition is true. In C, there are different types of loops, each with its own characteristics and syntax. Depending on the problem you're facing, you can choose the loop that fits best.


### while Loop

Repeats a block of code as long as a specified **condition** is true.

#### Syntax
```c
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char letter = 'A';
    while (letter != 'E') {
        printf("letter: %c\n", letter);
        letter++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
letter: A
letter: B
letter: C
letter: D
```


### do-while Loop

Similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the **code block is executed at least once**, as the condition is evaluated after the execution of the block.

#### Syntax
```c
do {
    // code to be executed
    // this code block will be executed before checking the condition
} while (condition);
```

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int j = 0;
    do {
        printf("j: %d\n", j);
        j++;
    } while (j < 3);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
j: 0
j: 1
j: 2
```


### for Loop

Used when you know how many times you want to loop through a block of code.

#### Syntax
```c
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
##### Execution
*   **Initialization:** Executed once before the loop starts.
*   **Condition:** Evaluated before each iteration. If true, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates.
*   **Increment/Decrement:** Executed after each iteration.

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        printf("k: %d\n", k);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
##### Iteration steps
1. **Initialize** `k` with the value `0`.
2. **Evaluate the condition** `k < 3`, If true, start the first iteration, otherwise, the loop terminates.
3. After the first iteration finishes, **execute** `k++` and then **evaluate the condition** `k < 3` before starting the second iteration.

Output
```
k: 0
k: 1
k: 2
```


## Jump Statements
Control flow statements that **transfer the execution of a program to another part of the program**, bypassing the normal sequential flow of control.


### break Statement
Used to **terminate** the loop immediately.

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
        }
        printf("i: %d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
> The `for` loop should continue the iteration 10 times, but the `break` statement **terminated** the loop after 5 iteration.    

Output
```
i: 0
i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
```

### continue Statement

Used to **skip the current iteration** of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            continue; // Skip this iteration when i is 5
        }
        printf("i: %d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
> The `for` loop should be printing the numbers from 0 to 9, but the `continue` statement **skipped** the 6th loop iteration ignoering printing the number 5.

Output
```
i: 0
i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
i: 6
i: 7
i: 8
i: 9
```
### goto Statement

The `goto` statement allows you to transfer control of the program to a labeled statement. While it provides **unconditional jump**, its use is generally discouraged in modern programming due to potential for creating spaghetti code and making programs hard to read and maintain.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    loop_start:
        printf("i: %d\n", i);
        i++;
        if (i < 3) {
            goto loop_start;
        }
    printf("Loop finished.");
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
i: 0
i: 1
i: 2
Loop finished.
```
> The `goto` statement tranfered the control of the program to the labeled statement `loop_start:`.

## Practice
Write a loop that prints the english letters from `A` to `Z`.

```c

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    // add your code here 
    return 0;
}

```
