# Array

The `array` is a fixed-size collection of multiple values stored in a single variable.

#### Key Points

- An array can hold a collection of primitive data types (such as **int**, **char**, etc.) or user-defined data types (such as **pointers** or **structs**).
- `Length` (a.k.a size) of an array refers to the number of elements it can store.
- Each element can be accessed directly using its `index`.
- Array indices represent the position of elements. In most programming languages (including C), they start from **0** up to **n-1** (where **n** is the arrayâ€™s size).


### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

In C, you must declare an array before using it, specifying its **type**, **name**, and **size**.

```c
data_type array_name[size];
```

- **data_type**: The type of values the array will store (e.g., int).
- **array_name**: The identifier for the array.
- **size**: The number of elements the array can hold.

**Example:** Declaring an array of three integers.

```c
int numbers[3];
```

### Assigning Values

You can assign values to each element using its index.

```c
numbers[0] = 25; // first element is 25
numbers[1] = 28; // second element is 28
numbers[2] = 31; // third element is 31
```

### Initializing During Declaration

You can initialize an array when you declare it.

```c
int numbers[3] = {25, 28, 31};
```

You can also initialize an array as follows.

```c
int numbers[] = {25, 28, 31}; // size is 3
```
The compiler knows its size is 3, as we are initializing it with 3 elements.

### Accessing Array Elements

To access or modify a specific element, use its index.

```c
printf("%d\n", numbers[0]); // prints 25
numbers[0] = 90;            // changes the first element to 90
printf("%d\n", numbers[0]); // prints 90
```

### Array Size

Use the `sizeof` operator to get the total size of the array in bytes.

```c
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(numbers)); // prints 12
```

> The integer type typically occupies 4 bytes, and since the array contains 3 elements, the total size is 4 * 3 = 12 bytes.


To find the number of elements in the array, divide the array's size by the size of a single element.

```c
int length = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]); // 12 / 4 = 3
```

## Example
Create an array of five characters
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize an array of five characters
    char letters[] = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'};

    // Print the first element
    printf("First letter: %c\n", letters[0]); // Output: A

    // Modify the third element (index 2)
    letters[2] = 'Z';
    printf("Third letter: %c\n", letters[2]); // Output: Z

    // Calculate and print the number of elements
    int size = sizeof(letters) / sizeof(letters[0]);
    printf("Number of letters: %d\n", size); // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
```

## Practice
Write a C program that:
1. Declares an array named **scores** to store the exam scores of 5 students.
2. Initializes the array with the following values: 78.0, 85.5, 62.0, 90.0, 74.5.
3. Prints all the scores using a loop.
4. Changes the lowest score to 80.5.
5. Prints the updated scores.
6. Calculates and prints the average score.
7. Prints the number of students.

#### Sample Output
```
Original scores:
78.0 85.5 62.0 90.0 74.5 
Updated scores:
78.0 85.5 80.5 90.0 74.5 
Average score: 81.70
Number of students: 5
```
