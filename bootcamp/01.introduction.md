# Introduction
   
The `C` programming language is a general-purpose, high-level language that is known for its speed and efficiency. It provides programmers with the ability to access and manipulate computer memory directly, making it highly recommended for developing compilers and operating systems.
    
   
Many programming languages, including Python, have been developed using `C` or have borrowed syntax and features from it.    

Learning `C` is essential as it helps to understand computer foundational concepts that are pivotal in programming.

## Concept   

### Program Structure

1. `main` function    
The starting point of every C program.   
```c
int main() {

}
```
<br>

2. `return` statement    
It indicates the termination of the program and in which state. If the program returns 0, it has been successfully executed. Otherwise there was an error.    
```c
int main() {

    return 0;
}
```
<br>

3. `#include <stdio.h>`    
`stdio.h` is the standard input-output library. It allows us to read from and write to the console. We can include libraries using the preprocessor directive `#` and `include` statement written together `#include`.     
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    return 0;
}

```   
<br>

4. `printf` function    
One of the functions provided by the `stdio.h` library. Itâ€™s used for displaying output to the console.   
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello from C");
    return 0;
}
``` 
<br>

### Compile  
There are multiple compilers for `C` language, such as **gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)** or **clang**.    
We are going to use **gcc**.


- Assuming the file name of the program is `hello.c` 
- Open the terminal in the file directory.
- Run the command: `gcc hello.c -o hello`. This command will produce the executable file **hello**.
> You could find a C compiler already installed on your device.


### Run   


To run the executable file **hello**:
- Run command: `./hello`.    
     
### Output
   
```
Hello, World!
```
   
 
## Practice

Write a `C` program that prints **"I'm a C programmer"** to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Add your code here
    return 0;
}
