## Pointer

A pointer is a **variable that stores the memory address of another variable**. Pointers are a fundamental and powerful feature in C, allowing for direct memory manipulation and dynamic memory allocation.

### Declaring Pointers

#### Syntax
```c
dataType *pointerName;
```

* The `*` (asterisk) is used to declare a pointer variable.

#### Example

```c
int *ptr; // Declares a pointer to an integer
char *chPtr; // Declares a pointer to a character
```

### Initializing Pointers

To store the address of a variable in a pointer, use the `&` (address-of) operator. The address-of operator `&` is used to retrieve the memory address of a variable.

#### Example

```c
int value = 10;
int *ptr_value = &value; // ptr_value now holds the memory address of 'value'
```
The address of the variable `value` is accessed using the address-of operator `&`. In the above example, if `value` is located at the address **0x16baaf158**, then `ptr_value` will contain that address. Therefore, when you print `ptr_value`, it will display that address.

### Dereferencing

Dereferencing a pointer is the process of accessing the value stored at the memory address that the pointer holds. In C, the dereferencing operator is the asterisk (`*`), which, when placed before a pointer, **refers to the value at the address pointed to by the pointer, rather than the address itself**. This is a critical operation, as it allows us to interact with the actual data that a pointer is referencing.

Let's consider an integer variable `value` and an integer pointer `ptr_value` that points to `value`,
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int *ptr_value = &value; // ptr_value now holds the memory address of 'value'

    printf("Value: %d\n", value); // Outputs: 10
    printf("Address of value: %p\n", &value); // Outputs: Memory address e.g, 0x16d793158
    printf("Value of ptr_value (address): %p\n", ptr_value); // Same memory address
    printf("Value pointed to by ptr_value: %d\n", *ptr_value); // Outputs: 10 (dereferencing)

    return 0;
}
```
printing `*ptr_value` will output value at address pointed by `ptr_value` which is 10. Here, the `*ptr_value` expression **dereferences** the pointer.    

Output
```
Value: 10
Address of value: 0x16f8eb158
Value of ptr_value (address): 0x16f8eb158
Value pointed to by ptr_value: 10
```

#### Updating Values After Altering from the Pointer Value
Pointers allow us to update the variable **values** using the dereferencing operator. This means that any changes made through the dereferenced pointer will directly affect the original variable value.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int *ptr_value = &value;

    printf("Value: %d\n", value); // Outputs: 10
    *ptr_value = 20; // Change the value through the pointer
    printf("New value: %d\n", value); // Outputs: 20

    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Value: 10
New value: 20
```

### Pointer Arithmetic

Pointers can be incremented or decremented, which moves them to the next or previous memory location of the data type they point to.
Pointers increment and decrement values depend on the data type they have been declared as. If the pointer is declared as `int`, it will be incremented by 4 bytes and decremented by 4 bytes as well.

> [!NOTE]
> `int` size is 4 bytes.
> `short` size is 2 bytes.

#### Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int integerNumber = 10;
    short shortNumber = 20;

    int *integerPtr = &integerNumber; // ptr points to the (integerNumber)

    printf("Integer pointer increment/decrement \n");

    printf("Pointer value : %p\n", integerPtr); 
    integerPtr++; // Move to the next integer +4 bytes
    printf("Pointer value after increment (+4 bytes) : %p\n", integerPtr); 
    integerPtr += 2; // Move two integers forward +8 bytes
    printf("Pointer value after increment (+8 bytes) : %p\n", integerPtr); 
    integerPtr--; // Move to the previous integer -4 bytes
    printf("Pointer value after decrement (-4 bytes) : %p\n", integerPtr); 

    short *shortPtr = &shortNumber; // ptr points to the (shortNumber)

    printf("Short pointer increment/decrement \n");

    printf("Pointer value : %p\n", shortPtr); 
    shortPtr++; // Move to the next short +2 bytes
    printf("Pointer value after increment (+2 bytes) : %p\n", shortPtr); 
    shortPtr += 2; // Move two short forward +4 bytes
    printf("Pointer value after increment (+4 bytes) : %p\n", shortPtr); 
    shortPtr--; // Move to the previous short +2 bytes
    printf("Pointer value after decrement (-2 bytes) : %p\n", shortPtr); 

    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Integer pointer increment/decrement 
Pointer value : 0x16f36f158
Pointer value after increment (+4 bytes) : 0x16f36f15c
Pointer value after increment (+8 bytes) : 0x16f36f164
Pointer value after decrement (-4 bytes) : 0x16f36f160
Short pointer increment/decrement 
Pointer value : 0x16f36f156
Pointer value after increment (+2 bytes) : 0x16f36f158
Pointer value after increment (+4 bytes) : 0x16f36f15c
Pointer value after decrement (-2 bytes) : 0x16f36f15a
```

### Practice

Create a program that demonstrates the use of pointers by manipulating a `char` variable through a pointer. You will also practice pointer arithmetic.

* **Declare a char variable**: Create a char variable and initialize it with a value.
* **Declare a pointer**: Create a pointer variable that will point to the char variable.
* **Print the value and address**: Print the value of the char variable, the address of the variable, and the value pointed to by the pointer.
* **Modify the value**: Change the value of the char variable through the pointer and print the new value.
* **Pointer arithmetic**: Move the pointer two chars (+2 bytes) forward and print its value.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Add your code here
    return 0;
}
```
