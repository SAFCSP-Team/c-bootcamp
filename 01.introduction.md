# Introduction

The `C` programming language is a general-purpose, high-level language that is widely used for system programming, application development, and embedded systems. Developed in the early 1970s, `C` provides low-level access to memory and is known for its efficiency and performance. It serves as the foundation for many modern programming languages and is essential for understanding computer science principles.   

## Concept   

### Instruction Flow
All programs follow a consistent pattern, executing a set of instructions in a specific order. This section will explain how instructions are organized and executed in the `C` language.

A program consists of instructions that are executed sequentially to complete a task. For instance, a program to sum two numbers will include the following steps:

1. Initialize the first number `num1`.
2. Initialize the second number `num2`.
3. Calculate the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

These instructions are executed one after another.

In `C`, instructions are executed in order unless a **control flow** statement changes that order by skipping or repeating certain instructions. We can alter the flow of these instructions using **control flow** statements provided by the language, such as `for` loops and `if` statements.

### Print
The `print statement` is a method for displaying text on an output device, such as the console screen.

In `C`, we use the `printf` function to print text. Here’s an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello from C");
    return 0;
}
```

Let’s break down this code line by line to understand the structure of a `C` program and the print statement:

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input-output library, which allows us to read from and write to the console.
- `main()`: This defines the main function, which every `C` program must have. It serves as the entry point for execution.
- `int` is the return type of the `main` function. If `main` returns 0, the program has executed successfully; a non-zero return indicates an error.
- `printf("Hello from C");`: This line calls the printf function to print the specified text. By default, the output goes to the console.
- `return 0;`: This line terminates the program and indicates success with an exit code of 0.    

The output of the above code is:

```
Hello from C
```
    
> Any line that starts with `#` is called a preprocessor directive.   
<br>

## Example

A simple example of a `C` program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

1. Create a file with ".c" extention, we will create **hello.c** file.
2. Open **hello.c**.
3. Write your code.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
4. Open the terminal.
5. Compile the program, run command: `gcc hello.c -o hello`.
6. Run the program, run command: `./hello`.
7. Output:
 
```
Hello, World!
```

## Practice

Write a `C` program that prints "C Language" to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Add your code here
    return 0;
}
```
- Compile.
- Run.
- Output:

```
C Language
```
